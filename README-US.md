## ðŸ’» Project

Project for learning basic contents in front-end programming, using HTML5 and CSS3 to create a Landing Page.

<br>

The project was produced following the video tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llF6vD-RljE">Rafaella Ballerini</a> on YouTube. At first, I chose to do the project from scratch while taking notes and learning a little more about the elements and attributes used in HTML. Did the same with the selectors and the styling part of CSS. In addition, I took the opportunity to make several modifications into the base project, seeing what each part of the code actually did and to know why it was being used in each place.

<br>

### âš™ Update 
- Done on August 19, 2023.

<br>
On that date, I made a general update in the project, considering that many things were at disagreement with what would in fact be considered a good HTML code (aka semantic HTML) and even with CSS selectors. We could say that currently the project is already in a version 2.0.
